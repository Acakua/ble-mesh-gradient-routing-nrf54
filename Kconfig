config BT_MESH_GRADIENT_SRV_FORWARDING_TABLE_SIZE
    int "Forwarding table size"
    default 3
    range 1 255
    help
      Maximum number of entries in the forwarding table.
      Each entry contains address, RSSI, and gradient information
      for routing decisions. Larger values provide more routing
      options but consume more memory.

config BT_MESH_GRADIENT_SRV_MESSAGE_LENGTH
	int "Max length of the message to be sent over mesh"
	default 90
	range 0 255
	help
	  Impacts on memory size occupied by the buffer of a message to be
	  published. This does not include null terminator. The message must also
	  fit into the application SDU. Adjust BT_MESH_TX_SEG_MAX and
	  BT_MESH_RX_SEG_MAX to be able to receive the longest messages.

config BT_MESH_CHAT_SAMPLE_PRESENCE_CACHE_SIZE
	int "Presence cache size"
	default 10
	range 0 32767
	help
	  Presence cache stores previously received presence of chat clients.
	  Recommended to be as big as number of chat clients in the mesh network.

config BT_MESH_GRADIENT_SINK_NODE
    bool "Configure this node as sink node"
    default n
    help
      If enabled, this node will be configured as the sink node
      (gradient = 0) in the gradient routing protocol.
      Only ONE node in the network should have this enabled.
